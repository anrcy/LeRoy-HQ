LeRoy — wizard.py
=================
The `leroy init` first-run interview: "let's get to know each other."

Opens with a warm, non-technical greeting, then runs the phases from
onboarding-and-install.md. This is the point — EVERY answer writes a real file
into the memory vault, so the user watches their second brain get built in front
of them. Every step is skippable; pressing Enter (or typing "skip") takes a
sensible default and moves on.

  Greeting              -> reassures a total beginner; the CLI is home now
  Phase 1 — You         -> writes USER.md, tunes SOUL.md
  Phase 2 — Your work   -> seeds Goals/, Projects/, People/
  Phase 3 — Your tools  -> optional MCP setup, writes Reference/ + .env stubs
  Phase 4 — How you like things done -> seeds Feedback/
  Phase 5 — Autonomy menu -> a la carte, DEFAULT OFF, writes config/autonomy.json
  Phase 6 — Subscription  -> plain-English guidance (Pro vs Max; no local model needed)
  Phase 7 — Shortcuts     -> status check only; installer\shortcuts.ps1 (run
                             earlier by setup.ps1) is the sole creator of the
                             "Leroy" + "Leroy CLI" Desktop shortcut pair

Autonomy philosophy: ship the working car. Good non-burning features are ON by
default; token-burning / autonomous features are OFF by default and offered one
at a time. Nothing autonomous is installed or scheduled here — we only RECORD the
user's picks to ~/.claude/config/autonomy.json; `leroy enable <feature>` wires
each one later.

The vault lives at ~/.claude/memory/ (never hardcoded). If a
memory.seed/ template tree exists in the repo it is used to pre-create the
folder skeleton; otherwise we create the folders ourselves.

Stdlib only. All prompts are plain input() so this works in any terminal.

    Desktop shortcut status check — NOT creation.

    installer\\shortcuts.ps1 (called from setup.ps1 step 5, BEFORE this
    interview ever starts) is the single, authoritative owner of Desktop
    shortcut creation. This build is CLI-first and ships no desktop app, so it
    creates exactly ONE shortcut: "Leroy CLI" (a terminal that opens in
    ~/.claude and starts Claude Code there). This phase only reports whether
    that shortcut is present — it never creates anything (a second creation
    path for the same Desktop is a correctness bug waiting to happen).
