**Tie-break:** on keyword collision, a task-type keyword (e.g. deck/proposal) beats a subject-matter keyword (e.g. a project name).

> **Opt-in security module:** An authorized-testing squad (offensive-security / OSINT / AI-security agents) ships separately behind an authorization-acknowledgment gate. Install it with `leroy add security`. Those agents are not part of the core roster and are not listed here.

## Agent Types

This folder contains **production agents** - fully specified, routable agents with auto-spawn rules. Related documentation exists elsewhere:

### 1. Production Agents (This Folder)
Standalone agents with complete specifications, routing keywords, auto-spawn triggers, and defined responsibilities.

**Registered agents (executable):**
- conductor, builder, designer, forge
- guardian, professor, scout, planner, janitor
- legal, quick, secretary, mesh-wrapper (infrastructure)
- skill-matcher (COO no-match routing fallback — infrastructure)
- goal-overseer (autonomous /goal step executor — background)
- proposal-writer (presentation generation)
- scraper (web extraction)
- cto, cfo, cko, hr, scrum-leader, vp-engineering (leadership)
- tech-lead (infra / CI-CD / DevOps manager — under VP Engineering)
- chief-of-staff (morning briefing coordination, department status)
- simulator (protocol testing, validation)
- alignment-monitor (Skill-agent alignment guardian - orphan detection, routing audits)

**Reference docs (not executable agents — read by COO/CTO for governance):**
- `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` — quick agent lookup card
- `c-suite-tool-constraints.md` — C-suite write-tool restrictions
- `org-governance.md` — full 5-tier org hierarchy & role rules

**How to use:** Reference by name in CLAUDE.md quick triggers or route via keywords in the Routing Table above.

### 2. Infrastructure Docs (skills/meta/)
Guides and reference documentation for the agent system.

- `agent-creator.md` - Guide for creating new production agents
- `sub-agent-spawning.md` - Infrastructure for background agent execution

**How to use:** Read for understanding system design, agent patterns, and best practices. Not agents themselves.

## Deployment Rules

### Rule 1: Overseer Always Required

**Every substantial task requires conductor as overseer.**

```yaml
Minimum team: Overseer + 1 Helper

No task executes with just a helper agent.
No helper agent works without overseer coordination.
```

### Rule 2: Auto-Spawn Agents

| Agent | Auto-Spawns When |
|-------|------------------|
| conductor | Substantial task detected (3+ steps, multi-file) |
| guardian | Commit or PR preparation |
| scout | Substantial task (background, via Task tool) |
| planner | 3+ line items detected OR todo keywords (background, via Task tool) |
| secretary | ALL substantial tasks (Priority 0/1) - background timeline tracking |
| chief-of-staff | Morning trigger - department status collection and briefing coordination |
| quick | Trivial request or quick trigger (100% coverage goal) |

### Rule 3: Helper Assignment

| Task Type | Overseer | Helper(s) |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Code implementation | conductor | builder |
| UI/design work | conductor | designer + builder |
| Large data operations | conductor | forge |
| Domain-expertise work | conductor | professor |
| Before any commit | conductor | guardian |
| Complex feature | conductor | builder + designer + guardian |
| **Legal/Contract Work** | | |
| Contract drafting | conductor | legal |
| Contract review | conductor | legal |
| Pre-signing verification | conductor | legal |
| Negotiation support | conductor | legal |
| **Web Extraction** | | |
| Single page scrape | conductor | scraper |
| Structured data extraction | conductor | scraper |
| Multi-page crawl | conductor | scraper |
| Batch URL extraction | conductor | scraper + forge |

## Agent Scaling Tiers

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Work Packets | Structure | Max Agents | Capacity |
|------|--------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Tier-1** | 1-3 | 1 arch + helpers | 5 | Entry level |
| **Tier-2** | 4-9 | 1 arch + 2-3 sub-arch + helpers | 12 | Standard |
| **Tier-3** | 10-15 | 1 arch + 5 sub-arch + helpers | 18 | Large |
| **Tier-4** | 16+ | 1 arch + ceil(packets/3) sub-arch + helpers | 20+ | Enterprise |

### Maximize Rule (CRITICAL)

```yaml
ALWAYS spawn to tier capacity, not minimum.

Example - Tier 2 task (6 work packets):
  WRONG: [1] arch [1] techy              # Minimum - slow, sequential
  RIGHT: [1] arch [2] sub-arch [6] techy [1] sentinel  # Maximize - parallel

Rationale:
  - Parallel execution
  - Faster completion
  - Better quality (more review)
  - Utilize available capacity
```

### Agent Count Notation

```yaml
Format: [N] type

Types:
  arch     = conductor
  sub-arch = sub-architect (tier 2+)
  techy    = builder
  uiux     = designer
  data     = forge
  sentinel = guardian
  growth   = scout
  micro    = quick

Examples:
  [1] arch [3] techy [1] sentinel           # Tier-1
  [1] arch [2] sub-arch [5] techy [1] uiux  # Tier-2
  [1] micro                                  # Trivial (100% coverage)
```

### Sub-Architect Hierarchy

```yaml
When to use sub-architects:
  - Tier-2 or higher (4+ work packets)
  - Need parallel execution streams
  - Multiple domains in single task

Structure:
  Main Architect (overseer)
  ├── Sub-Arch 1 → [techy, uiux] → packets 1-3
  ├── Sub-Arch 2 → [techy, data] → packets 4-6
  └── Sub-Arch 3 → [techy, sentinel] → packets 7-9

Rules:
  - Each sub-arch handles max 3 packets
  - Sub-arch reports to main conductor
  - Sub-arch can spawn own helpers
  - Main conductor coordinates all streams
```

### Capacity Planning

```yaml
Calculate tier:
  packets = count distinct work items
  if packets <= 3:  tier = 1, max = 5
  if packets <= 9:  tier = 2, max = 12
  if packets <= 15: tier = 3, max = 18
  if packets > 15:  tier = 4, max = 20+

Spawn formula:
  arch = 1 (always)
  sub-arch = ceil(packets / 3) - 1 (tier 2+)
  techy = packets (one per work packet)
  uiux = 1 per UI-related packet
  sentinel = 1 (if commit involved)
  growth = 1 (background, always on substantial)
```

**Rule:** No single team handles more than 3 work packets.

## Handoff Protocols

### Standard Handoffs

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| conductor | builder | Code implementation needed |
| conductor | designer | UI/design decisions needed |
| conductor | forge | Large data operation needed |
| conductor | guardian | Before any commit |
| conductor | professor | Domain-expertise work needed |
| conductor | legal | Contract drafting or review needed |
| builder | conductor | Implementation complete, needs QC |
| designer | conductor | Design complete, needs QC |
| guardian | conductor | Audit complete, ready for merge |
| scout | conductor | Patterns ready to surface |
| legal | conductor | Contract review complete, ready for decision |
| legal | secretary | Contract action complete, needs tracking |
| secretary | chief-of-staff | Morning routine - provide 24h event summary |
| chief-of-staff | conductor | Briefing complete, critical items flagged |
| chief-of-staff | secretary | Connector failure creates one-off reminder |

### Growth Monitor Handoff

```yaml
When scout has suggestions:
  1. scout accumulates patterns
  2. At breakpoint: outputs [GROWTH] block
  3. Main conversation checks output
  4. If user selects "Review":
     - Load skill-creator.md or agent-creator.md
     - Present draft for approval
```
